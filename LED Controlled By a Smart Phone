Experiment 4 - LED Controlled By a Smart Phone
In this experiment, we created a LED which is controlled by a Smart Phone APP with the help of an Arduino. In this we connect a bluetooth module to the Arduino which would recieve the on/off signal from the Smart Phone (using the in-built bluetooth of Smart Phone) and hence will turn the LED on or off.
